Aristotelica is a sans serif rounded geometric type family designed by Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini and Andrea Tartarelli developing the original philosophy of one of the classic and best-selling Zetafonts typefaces, Arista by Francesco Canovaro. 

This font shows its strengths mostly in display uses and logo design.

A text variant, Aristotelica Text has been developed for 7 out of the 8 display weights, applying slight corrections to design and metrics to allow the perfect legibility in paragraph text.
The family is further enriched by the inclusion of Aristotelica Icons, a set of matching variable-width monoline icons that can be used to faultlessly match the typeface line width.

All Aristotelica fonts include Greek and Cyrillic alphabets as well as an extended range of latin characters, covering over forty languages. Open type features includes stylistic alternates, old style and lining figures and small caps.
